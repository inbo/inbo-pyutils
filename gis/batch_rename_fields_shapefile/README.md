# Batch rename the fields of a shapefile

## Introduction

This tool provides a quick method to batch rename the fieldnames (columnnames) of a shapefile. 



## Aim

The aim is to rename multiple fields in a shapefile table in one loop (unlike ArcMap, where fields have to be renamed one by one).



## Parameters

**Input**

* Input shapefile.
* A textfile that stores the old and new fieldnames.

**Output**

* Output shapefile.
